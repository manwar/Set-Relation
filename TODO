                               Set::Relation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following is a summary of things that still need doing.

* Add code examples, tutorial, cookbook, FAQ, etc.

* Make the test suite actually run the code, not just compile it; maybe
start off with running same code examples in documentation, tutorial, etc.

* Consider adding public operators such as for comparing headings eg for
disjointness etc, mirroring some set operators, perhaps to help users
implement more operators?

* Consider adding disjoint insertion, union operators (same as normal but
fails on a duplicate).

* Consider adding support for explicit keys / unique key constraints /
automatic key detection on Set::Relation objects.  If properly exploited
this may lead to improved performance by letting one hash each
Set::Relation's member tuples just on the subtuple that is a key rather
than on the whole tuple.  But doing this properly will probably make the
module about 20-50% more complicated.  This would certainly be much simpler
if the objects did not mutate.

* Consider adding more mutator methods.

* Improve performance.

* Port this to Perl 6 again; meanwhile, a much older initial version
pre-dating this Perl 5 rewrite already exists FYI.

* Whatever else needs doing, such as, fixing bugs.
